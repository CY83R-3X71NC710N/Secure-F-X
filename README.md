## Introduction
Secure-F-X is a Python-based facial recognition system designed to detect threats and respond accordingly using openCV, dlib, PIL libraries, and ML algorithms tracking motion and facial recognition data to block cyber intrusions. This project is a prototype and will likely need to be updated to run on the reader's own machine, with URLs and possible keys needing to be updated as well. This project is a work in progress and as of now it should be built off and extended to become more powerful. 

## Project Goals
- To create a facial recognition system that can detect cyber threats and respond accordingly 
- To use openCV, dlib, PIL libraries, and ML algorithms to track motion and facial recognition data 
- To use Python as the programming language of choice
- To create a secure system that is difficult to breach

## Roadmap
- Create a prototype of the facial recognition system
- Utilize openCV, dlib, PIL libraries and ML algorithms to track motion and facial recognition data
- Implement Python as the programming language of choice
- Create a secure system that is difficult to breach

## What This Project Could Become
This project could become a powerful tool for companies and individuals who need to protect their data and networks from cyber threats. It could be used to detect and respond to threats quickly and accurately, and could be used to track motion and facial recognition data in order to block cyber intrusions. 

## Unique Features
Secure-F-X is unique in that it uses openCV, dlib, PIL libraries and ML algorithms to track motion and facial recognition data. This allows for a more secure system that is difficult to breach. Additionally, this project is written entirely in Python, which is an easy to use and powerful language. 

## License
This project is licensed under the MIT license.

## Checkboxes
- [x] Create prototype

## Conclusion
Secure-F-X is a prototype created as a proof of concept for a facial recognition system that can detect threats and respond accordingly. It is written in Python and uses openCV, dlib, PIL libraries, and ML algorithms to track motion and facial recognition data. This project is a work in progress and should be built off and extended to become more powerful. Any APIs used are closed source and a work in progress and likely will not be released to public due to licensing agreements, therefore someone should create an open source alternative to any closed-source APIs.
